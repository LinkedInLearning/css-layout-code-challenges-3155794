        Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite
        sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this
        nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do
        because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state

        have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to

        Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own
        business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling,
        worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact
        with different people all the time so that you can never get to know
        anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!
